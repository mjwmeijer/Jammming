playlist name is not reset after calling Spotify.saveplaylist, please look into App.js

Additional note:

Here the first time, results are shown for a short period of time, then the page refreshes and results disappear. After this  automatic refresh, in the address bar of the browser the access token is visible.
From then on, searching works fine and the access token in address bar disappears again.  Any ideas?
